hg-dotlog - writes a "dot" compatible revision history

This is an alternative to the "graphviz" plugin for hg.  It works well for me but has few other users so it probably has lots of rough edges.

As always, this software comes with no warranty express or implied.  If it breaks you get to keep both pieces.
